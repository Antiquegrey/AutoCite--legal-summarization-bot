This legal document concerns an appeal to a higher court after the High Court set aside concurrent findings of fact by lower tribunals. The appellants claimed to be tenants of agricultural land and sought occupancy rights under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1974. Their claim was based on alleged cultivation since 1968 on a share basis and entries in the Record of Rights (RTC). The respondents disputed the tenancy, arguing the land was mortgaged, and that the father of the appellants was merely allowed to cultivate it as a relative of the mortgagee, not as a tenant.

The Land Tribunal initially granted occupancy rights, but the High Court, in revision, overturned this decision, finding insufficient evidence of tenancy. This was upheld on appeal by the Appellate Authority. The High Court, in its revisional jurisdiction, found that the appellants and their father failed to prove tenancy, noting the absence of lease agreements, rent receipts, and inconsistent claims about the tenancy's origin. The High Court also observed that the RTC entries did not conclusively establish tenancy and that the relationship between the parties (uncle and nephew) could suggest cultivation as a family member rather than a tenant, particularly under Section 4 of the Act.

Despite the High Court setting aside concurrent findings of fact, the higher court, in its discretionary power under Article 136 of the Constitution, found no reason to interfere. The court reasoned that the High Court's revisional power under Section 121A of the Act was broader than under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, allowing it to re-examine evidence when findings were perverse, unsupported by evidence, or based on ignored material evidence. The court agreed with the High Court's assessment that the appellants failed to prove tenancy, citing the lack of rent payment, inconsistencies in claims, and the RTC entries not supporting their tenancy. Furthermore, even if the High Court's decision was debatable, the court found the High Court's view plausible and in accordance with the justice of the case, declining to interfere under Article 136. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed.
