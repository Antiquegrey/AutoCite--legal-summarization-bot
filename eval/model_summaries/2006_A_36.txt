This case involves an appeal against an order of detention issued under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). The appellant, a managing director of an export company, was accused of misdeclaring the value and description of goods, specifically exporting non-alloy steel in the guise of alloy steel at inflated prices and routing excess proceeds through unofficial channels. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) conducted searches and recovered incriminating documents, and statements were recorded from the appellant and an associate, Prabhjot Singh.

The appellant was detained, and his subsequent writ of habeas corpus was dismissed by the High Court. The appeal to the Supreme Court raised several grounds, including unexplained delay in passing the detention order, non-placement of vital documents before the detaining authority, and non-supply of relied-upon documents to the detainee.

The Supreme Court found that while some delay was explained, a significant portion remained unexplained. Critically, the Court highlighted that crucial documents, including civil court proceedings and letters from the DRI indicating that transactions after a certain date were not under scrutiny, were not placed before the detaining authority. Furthermore, self-incriminating statements made by the appellant and Prabhjot Singh, which were relied upon in the detention order, were not supplied to the appellant, even in xeroxed copies. The Court emphasized that the right to make an effective representation is a constitutional and statutory right, and the non-supply of material documents prejudiced this right.

Consequently, the Supreme Court quashed the order of detention, finding that the delay was not adequately explained, material documents were withheld, and the appellant was denied the opportunity to make an effective representation. The appeal was allowed.
