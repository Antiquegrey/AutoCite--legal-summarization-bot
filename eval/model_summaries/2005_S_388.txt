This case concerns an appeal by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) against a High Court order that granted the benefit of probation to the second respondent, Gurcharan Singh, despite his conviction for unauthorized construction. The MCD argues that the High Court erred by not calling for a probation officer's report and by not considering Gurcharan Singh's previous conviction for a similar offense. Gurcharan Singh's defense claims that his counsel had informed the High Court about his lengthy trial and short period of custody, and that the state's counsel did not object to the probation. The High Court initially granted probation, setting aside the imprisonment and fine, citing the 12 years Gurcharan Singh had already faced trial and his brief custody. However, the Supreme Court criticizes the High Court's decision, highlighting Gurcharan Singh's failure to disclose his prior conviction and holding that this constitutes playing fraud on the court. The Supreme Court emphasizes the mandatory nature of obtaining a probation officer's report under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and finds that Gurcharan Singh, as a previous convict, was not eligible for probation under the Act. Consequently, the Supreme Court sets aside the High Court's order and remands the matter for fresh disposal, also imposing costs on Gurcharan Singh for his conduct.
