This is an appeal against a conviction under Section 51C of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The appellant, a Garrison Engineer, was accused of misappropriating the value of standing crops on land acquired for the extension of an airbase. The prosecution alleged that the appellant, after taking possession of the land with standing crops, sold the crops to individuals for a significantly reduced price, facilitated their removal, and pocketed the proceeds without accounting for them to the government. The appellant's defense argued that there were no standing crops when he took possession of the land, that possession was delivered to the contractor earlier, and that the crop was damaged or removed before he received possession. The courts below convicted the appellant, and the High Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The Supreme Court considered arguments regarding the validity of the sanction for prosecution and the merits of the evidence. The Court found that the sanction was validly granted and that the evidence, including documentary proof of standing crops on the acquired land when possession was taken by the appellant, supported the conviction. The Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the concurrent findings of guilt by the lower courts.
