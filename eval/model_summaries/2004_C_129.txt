This case involves two appeals challenging a Madras High Court judgment that upheld the withdrawal of subsidy benefits previously extended to the appellants. The appellants argued that the withdrawal was unlawful, citing the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation, and alleging violations of natural justice, including a lack of opportunity to be heard and the retrospective application of the withdrawal. They also contended that the High Court relied on undisclosed materials from government files.

The respondent state argued that the appellants were not induced by any governmental action to establish their industries and that the principle of legitimate expectation did not apply as the benefits were concessions that could be withdrawn.

The High Court had found that the appellants did not have a vested right, were not induced by government orders, and that the withdrawal was in the public interest.

The Supreme Court, while acknowledging the principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation, and the importance of fairness and non-arbitrariness in state actions, noted that the High Court's decision was based on materials not fully disclosed to the appellants and that specific issues, such as the retrospective withdrawal and the justification for the withdrawal, were not adequately addressed. Therefore, the Supreme Court remitted the matter back to the High Court for a fresh consideration, directing the state to file further affidavits detailing the reasons for withdrawal and for the High Court to decide on the legality of retrospective withdrawal and to consider the legitimate expectation plea in light of the new materials. The Court emphasized that it was not expressing an opinion on the merits of the case.
