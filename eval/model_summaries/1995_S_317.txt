This document details an appeal against convictions and sentences handed down by a designated judge in Pune. Twelve individuals were initially tried for offenses under Section 302, 307, 149, 324, 147, 148 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 3 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA). Six were acquitted, one died during the trial, and five appellants were convicted.

The case stemmed from an altercation at a video parlor which escalated into an assault near Jagdamba Hotel, resulting in the death of one person (Popat) and injuries to two others (Bajrang and Baban). The prosecution alleged that the accused, armed with swords, satturs, and sticks, attacked the complainant party with the intent to cause terror, thus invoking TADA.

The appellate court analyzed the evidence, including witness testimonies and medical reports. It found that the prosecution had successfully established the participation of appellants A-5, A-8, A-9, and A-11 (along with the deceased A-1) in the unlawful assembly and the subsequent assault, leading to murder and injuries. However, the court found insufficient evidence to establish the identity and participation of appellant A-10 beyond a reasonable doubt, granting him the benefit of doubt and acquitting him.

Crucially, the appellate court overturned the convictions under Section 3 of TADA for all appellants. It determined that the incident, while a criminal act, did not demonstrate the specific intention required to "strike terror" in a section of the community as mandated by the TADA provisions. The court emphasized that TADA offenses require a higher threshold of intent and impact than ordinary criminal activity.

Consequently, the convictions and sentences for the TADA offense were set aside. The convictions and sentences for the IPC offenses (murder, attempted murder, and causing hurt with dangerous weapons, all with common intention under Section 149 IPC) for appellants A-5, A-8, A-9, and A-11 were upheld. Appellant A-10 was acquitted of all charges. The court also rejected a submission to transfer the appeal to the High Court, asserting its own jurisdiction under Section 19 of TADA for appeals against designated court judgments.
