This case concerns three appeals filed by the State of West Bengal, the State Fishery Development Corporation Ltd., and Bansilal Farms against a judgment of the Calcutta High Court. The dispute originated from a partition suit filed in 1955 concerning properties of the Sarkar family, including the Nalban fishery. A preliminary decree was passed, and a subsequent appeal was filed.

Crucially, the State of West Bengal requisitioned the Nalban fishery in 1969 under the West Bengal Land Requisition and Acquisition Act, 1948. The Sarkar family challenged this requisition unsuccessfully. While the partition suit was being resolved through a compromise decree in the Supreme Court, the State's rights over the fisheries were explicitly stated to be unaffected by the compromise. The Supreme Court also appointed a receiver to manage fisheries not yet vested in the State.

The core of the current dispute lies in the Calcutta High Court's subsequent orders directing the receiver to take possession of the Nalban fishery from the State and hand it over to the Sarkar family. The appellants (State, Corporation, and Bansilal Farms) argued that the High Court erred, as the State's rights over the fishery were protected by the Supreme Court's earlier orders and the valid requisition. They contended that the compromise decree could not divest the State of its acquired rights.

The respondents (Sarkar family) argued that the Supreme Court decree, passed in the presence of the State, should bind it, and the receiver was therefore justified in taking possession.

The Supreme Court, in its judgment, found that the State's rights over the Nalban fishery were indeed protected and unaffected by the partition decree. The Court noted that the fishery had been legally requisitioned and the State had been in possession since 1969, with the validity of the requisition upheld. The Court also clarified that a subsequent High Court order directing demarcation of the fishery was not res judicata against the State as the State was not a party to those proceedings. Furthermore, the Court acknowledged the potential vesting of tank fisheries in the State under amended land reform laws, though it deferred a definitive opinion pending a decision on the constitutionality of those amendments.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court set aside the impugned directions of the Calcutta High Court, allowed the appeals, vacated the injunction against Bansilal Farms, and directed the State to determine and pay compensation to the Sarkar family for the Nalban fishery.
