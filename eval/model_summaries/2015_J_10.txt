This document is an appeal concerning a criminal case originating from an altercation on November 18, 1994. The prosecution alleged that the appellants, armed with weapons, entered the complainant's land and inflicted injuries on him and his sons during an argument over cutting reeds. One of the sons, Sukhbir, sustained severe head injuries requiring surgery and potentially life-threatening if not treated.

The trial court convicted all accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including Section 307 (attempt to murder) and Section 325 (grievous hurt). The High Court partly allowed the appeal, modifying some convictions and sentences.

This appeal to a higher court challenges the High Court's judgment. The appellants argued that the evidence was inconsistent and that the defense of private defense was not properly considered. The prosecution contended that the injured witnesses' testimony was reliable and corroborated by medical evidence, proving the accused's intent.

The court, after reviewing the evidence, upheld the conviction of the second appellant (Rajbir/Raju) under Section 307 IPC, finding sufficient evidence of intent to cause death based on the weapon used, the severity of the injury, and the medical expert's opinion that Sukhbir would have died without surgery. However, the court reduced the sentence for the second appellant from five years to three years and ordered him to pay substantial compensation to the injured Sukhbir.

The court also reduced the sentences for the other appellants (Jage Ram, Madan, and Rakesh) to the period already undergone, noting the original occurrence was in 1994 and considering the circumstances. The convictions for these appellants were confirmed. The judgment specifies the distribution of the deposited compensation amount to the injured Sukhbir and outlines the consequences of failure to deposit the remaining compensation.
