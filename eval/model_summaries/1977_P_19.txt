This case involves an appeal against a High Court judgment concerning the calculation of maternity benefit under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. The core issue is whether "week" in the context of maternity benefit means a seven-day period including Sundays (even if wageless holidays) or a six-day working week.

The respondent, a woman worker in a plantation, was paid maternity benefit for 72 working days, excluding 12 Sundays that fell within her maternity leave period. She claimed payment for the full 84 days (12 weeks of 7 days each), arguing that a week comprises seven days.

The Labour Court ruled in favor of the respondent, which was initially upheld by a single judge of the High Court. However, a Letters Patent Bench of the High Court reversed this, stating that a week consists of seven days, including Sundays, and the respondent was entitled to maternity benefit for the entire 12-week period.

The Supreme Court, in its analysis, referred to dictionary definitions of "week" and the beneficial nature of the legislation, aimed at social justice for women workers. The Court concluded that "week" in the context of the Maternity Benefits Act means a period of seven days, including Sundays and other rest days. Therefore, maternity benefit should be calculated for the entire actual period of absence, which is up to six weeks before and including delivery, and six weeks after delivery, encompassing all days within those periods, regardless of whether they are working days or wageless holidays. The Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of the Letters Patent Bench and disagreeing with a previous Kerala High Court ruling on the matter.
