This case concerns the maintainability of a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The appellant's LPA was dismissed by a division bench on the grounds that it was not maintainable because the original order was passed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, which generally bars LPAs. The appellant argues that the High Court's dismissal was incorrect, as the original writ petition sought relief akin to Article 226, and this court had previously directed that the LPA be considered on merits.

The Supreme Court analyzes the distinction between Article 226 (writ of certiorari, original jurisdiction) and Article 227 (supervisory jurisdiction) of the Constitution, and how these distinctions affect the maintainability of LPAs under Section 21 of the M.P. Uchacha Nyayalay Khand Nyaypeeth Ko Appeal Adhiniyam, 2005. The Court emphasizes that the substance of the relief sought, rather than the article cited in the petition's cause title, determines the nature of the jurisdiction exercised and, consequently, the appealability of the order.

After reviewing various precedents, the Supreme Court concludes that the High Court erred in dismissing the LPA solely based on the mention of Article 227. The Court finds that the nature of the prayer in the writ petition was to quash the assessment order, which aligns more with Article 226, and that this court's earlier order clearly directed consideration of the LPA on merits. Therefore, the Supreme Court sets aside the High Court's order, directs that the writ appeal be heard on merits by the division bench, and allows the appeal.
