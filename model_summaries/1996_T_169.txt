This case concerns a dispute over the use of the "Raleigh" trademark. The respondents, who owned the trademark, had entered into various agreements with Sen Raleigh Limited, an Indian company, allowing them to use the trademark. Sen Raleigh Limited was eventually taken over by the Government of India and later nationalized, becoming the appellant.

The appellant sought to have the Raleigh trademark removed from the register, arguing that the respondents had not used the trademark for a continuous period of five years, a ground for removal under Section 46(1)(b) of the Act. The appellant also argued that the respondents failed to provide technical know-how and that their own use of the trademark after November 1, 1976, was not as a registered user.

The High Court and the Division Bench both dismissed the appellant's application for rectification. They found that the respondents had special circumstances that excused their non-use of the trademark, including the government takeover of Sen Raleigh Limited and restrictions on importing bicycles. They also held that the appellant's continued use of the trademark, even without formal registration as a permitted user, constituted a bona fide use on behalf of the registered proprietor, the respondents. The courts viewed the appellant's conduct as taking advantage of its own wrong in abandoning registered user applications while still using the trademark.

The Supreme Court, in this appeal, upheld the decisions of the lower courts. It found that the appellant's use of the trademark, even as an unregistered licensee, was with the implied permission of the respondent and therefore constituted a bona fide use. The Court emphasized the continuous trade connection between the parties and found no evidence of trafficking in the trademark. The Court also concluded that Section 46(3) regarding special circumstances was not attracted and that the High Court had properly exercised its discretion in refusing to rectify the trademark register.
