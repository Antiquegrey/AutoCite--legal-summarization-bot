This legal document concerns an appeal by the State of Manipur against a judgment by the Guwahati High Court. The High Court had upheld a single judge's decision that overturned the cancellation of temporary appointments made in the Revenue Department. The core issue revolves around appointments made by the Commissioner of Revenue, Shri A.J. Tayeng, for posts like mandols, process servers, and zilladars, allegedly without the knowledge of the State and without following proper recruitment procedures.

The State argued that the appointments were invalid because they were made without following constitutional mandates (Articles 14 and 16) and by an incompetent authority. The Commissioner himself initially denied making such appointments, stating that the Secretary of Revenue was making appointments without authority. However, he later submitted an affidavit supporting the writ petitioners, stating the appointments bore his signature and appeared to have been issued under his authority, though he lacked access to the files after retirement.

The High Court's single judge had found the cancellation orders to be bad in law due to inconsistencies in the State's reasoning and a failure to comply with the principles of natural justice. The Division Bench upheld this.

The Supreme Court, however, allowed the appeal by the State of Manipur. The Court reasoned that the appointments were potentially forged or made by an incompetent authority in violation of constitutional provisions. In such cases, the principles of natural justice were not required to be followed, as it would be a futile exercise. The Court found no arbitrariness in the State's action and concluded that the respondents had failed to prove a legal right to their posts. The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's judgments and allowed the appeals.
