This case involves civil appeals challenging a decision by the Customs, Excise, and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT). The appellants, M/s Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd., were denied an exemption under SSI notification No. 193/CE dated 28.02.1993, as amended. The department alleged that the appellants were using the brand name "Meghraj," which was a registered trademark of Kay Aar Biscuits Pvt. Ltd., thereby violating the conditions of the exemption notification.

The appellants argued that they had used the name "M/s Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd." on their wrappers since 1991 and that this use had never been challenged. They also contended that the logo belonged to Kay Aar Biscuits Pvt. Ltd., which was a closed unit, and that they had applied for registration of the "Meghraj" brand name. Their application for registration was later granted retrospectively with effect from 30.09.1991.

The authorities, including the adjudicating authority, the Commissioner (Appeals), and CEGAT, rejected these arguments. They found that the appellants had used the brand name "Meghraj" on their products, which was owned by Kay Aar Biscuits Pvt. Ltd., and that the exemption notification explicitly disallowed the use of a brand name belonging to another person. The courts referenced in the judgment emphasized that the purpose of the exemption was to assist small-scale industries that *did not* have the advantage of a brand name, not to protect established brand names.

The High Court, in its analysis, distinguished between the rights conferred by the Trade Marks Act and the purpose of excise law. It held that while the Trade Marks Act allows for retrospective registration, this fiction cannot extend to excise law to grant exemption benefits when the appellants had wrongly used another person's trademark. The court also addressed arguments concerning the abandonment of the trademark by Kay Aar Biscuits Pvt. Ltd., finding no sufficient evidence to support this claim. Ultimately, the appeals were dismissed.
