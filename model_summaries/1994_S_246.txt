This document outlines court orders and proceedings concerning admissions to minority educational institutions and the determination of seniority between direct recruits and promotees in the Forest Department.

**Minority Educational Institutions Admissions:**
The court is addressing petitions challenging the applicability of a previous scheme (J.P. Unni Krishnan v. State of A.P.) and state government rules regarding admissions to professional courses in institutions claiming minority status. Due to the complexity and importance of the questions involved, the court has reframed the issues and issued notice to the Attorney General and Advocates General. To manage the upcoming academic session, an interim order was issued. This order generally permits 50% of intake to be filled by state-selected candidates based on merit and the remaining 50% by the management to admit candidates from the minority community, also based on merit. Specific modifications and clarifications were made regarding free and payment seats, NRI admissions, and reporting procedures. Separate directions were given for specific institutions (W.P. Nos. 284 & 482 of 1993) that conduct their own all-India entrance tests based on merit and charge fees comparable to government institutions. The court also addressed the unique situation in Kerala, where agreements with the government dictate the admission process, and directed that admissions for the 1994 academic session would follow the established patterns, with merit being the guiding principle for management-discretion seats. The court explicitly stated it was not making pronouncements on the minority status of these institutions at this stage.

**Seniority of Forest Department Employees:**
The court is dealing with contempt petitions arising from a previous judgment (Keshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of India) regarding the inter se seniority of direct recruits and promotee Assistant Conservators of Forests in Uttar Pradesh. The core issue is the implementation of the J.P. Unni Krishnan judgment which established that promotees appointed on an ad hoc basis were not substantive members of the service and their ad hoc service could not count towards seniority. Direct recruits appointed according to rules had their seniority counted from their date of duty. The court found that while the State government made a mistake in law in determining seniority, it was not a case of outright contempt. The court directed the State to undertake a fresh exercise to determine seniority by considering substantive vacancies, applying the prescribed quotas for direct recruits and promotees for each year vacancies arose, and ensuring direct recruits are placed en bloc as seniors to promotees within their respective quotas. The court also addressed the treatment of temporary posts, suggesting they could be considered for seniority purposes if likely to continue and be made permanent. The contempt petitions were disposed of with these directions, and the State was given four months to complete the fresh exercise.
