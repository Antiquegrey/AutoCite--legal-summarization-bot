This case concerns an appeal against a conviction for house trespass and assault with intent to outrage modesty. The original charge stated that the appellant trespassed into the house of Prakashi Devi and assaulted her with intent to outrage her modesty. However, the evidence presented at trial indicated that the appellant assaulted and attempted to outrage the modesty of Prakashi Devi's daughter-in-law, Sheela Devi, not Prakashi Devi herself. The appellant argued that he was prejudiced by this discrepancy, as his defense focused on refuting the charges against Prakashi Devi. The appellate court and High Court had previously held that such a technical defect in the charge should not vitiate the conviction if the accused was not misled and no failure of justice occurred. The Supreme Court, in this instance, reviewed this principle. Applying the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr. P.C.) regarding the contents and effect of charges, particularly Sections 212, 215, and 464, and referencing established case law, the Court found that the error in the charge was material. Because the appellant concentrated his defense on the charge as framed against Prakashi Devi and did not have an opportunity to defend himself against allegations concerning Sheela Devi, he was misled and prejudiced, leading to a failure of justice. Consequently, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial with a corrected charge to reflect Sheela Devi as the victim of the assault.
