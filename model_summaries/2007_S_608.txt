This document details an appeal against a conviction under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for dowry death. The appellants, a husband and his mother, were convicted by the Sessions Court and their conviction was affirmed by the High Court. The deceased, Bhimabai, died of insecticide poisoning approximately two and a half years after her marriage. The prosecution alleged that the appellants harassed Bhimabai for dowry, leading to her death.

The court analyzed the evidence, particularly the testimony of the deceased's parents. While the parents claimed there were demands for money for household expenses and manure, the court found that these demands did not constitute a demand for dowry as defined by Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The court emphasized that a demand for money due to financial stringency or for ordinary domestic expenses cannot be considered a dowry demand.

Crucially, the court noted inconsistencies in the mother's (PW 5) statement to the police, where she did not initially mention a dowry demand as the cause of ill-treatment. The court also highlighted that the appellants had been acquitted of charges under Sections 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and 306 IPC (abetment of suicide), and this acquittal had become final as the state did not appeal it.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the High Court and Sessions Court judgments. The court concluded that since a key ingredient of Section 304B IPC, namely the demand for dowry, was not established, the conviction could not be sustained. The appellants were acquitted of the charge under Section 304B IPC.
