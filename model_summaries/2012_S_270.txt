This document details a legal case concerning the death of Pathan Haseena Begum, who allegedly committed suicide due to dowry harassment. The deceased was married to Pathan Hussain Basha, and her family had promised a dowry of Rs. 25,000, of which Rs. 15,000 was paid at the time of marriage. The balance of Rs. 10,000 was allegedly demanded by the accused (Pathan Hussain Basha, his father Pathan Khadar Basha, and his mother Pathan Nazeer Abi) after the marriage, leading to alleged harassment and cruelty towards the deceased. The prosecution's case is that the deceased was subjected to cruelty for non-payment of dowry, leading to her suicide by hanging on February 15, 2003.

The trial court convicted all three accused under Sections 304B and 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court, in appeal, acquitted the father-in-law (Pathan Khadar Basha) but upheld the conviction and sentence for the husband (Pathan Hussain Basha) and mother-in-law (Pathan Nazeer Abi). The Supreme Court, hearing further appeals, analyzed the legal ingredients of Section 304B and Section 113B of the Evidence Act, emphasizing the "soon before her death" and "in connection with any demand for dowry" clauses. While finding the evidence sufficient to establish guilt, the Supreme Court, considering the time already served by the convicted appellants and the attendant circumstances, reduced the sentence from life imprisonment to ten years of rigorous imprisonment for the offenses.
