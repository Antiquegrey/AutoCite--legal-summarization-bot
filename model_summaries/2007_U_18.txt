This case involves an appeal against the conviction and death sentence of Ujjagar Singh for the murder of his niece, Mukhtiar Kaur, and for rape and attempted suicide. The prosecution alleged that Ujjagar Singh shot Mukhtiar Kaur and then attempted to shoot himself. The defense argued that there was no evidence of rape, that the circumstantial evidence was insufficient, and that the attempted suicide was not credible due to the nature of the wound. The court found that the conviction for rape under Section 376 of the IPC could not be sustained due to a lack of evidence proving it was non-consensual. However, the court upheld the conviction for murder and attempted suicide, finding that the circumstantial evidence pointed to Ujjagar Singh as the perpetrator. The court commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment, acquitting the appellant of the rape charge.
