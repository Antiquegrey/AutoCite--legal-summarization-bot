This document details a legal dispute concerning the employment status of canteen workers in a cigarette manufacturing company. The company argued that a writ of mandamus should not lie against it because it is a private entity not performing a public duty. The respondent union, representing the canteen workers, sought to have them recognized as employees of the company, entitling them to benefits.

The High Court, in two instances (a single judge and a division bench), ruled in favor of the union, holding that even private entities performing statutory duties like maintaining a canteen under the Factories Act, 1948, are subject to writ jurisdiction when a public duty is involved. The company appealed this decision, primarily arguing that maintaining a canteen is merely a labor welfare measure and not a public duty, citing precedent that writ jurisdiction under Article 226 is generally for public duties, not private contractual matters.

However, upon reviewing the facts, the Supreme Court noted that the company exercised extensive control over the canteen's operations, including infrastructure, supplies, and supervision, suggesting the contractor was merely an agent of the company. Despite concluding that the High Court erred in exercising writ jurisdiction over a private entity in this context, the Supreme Court decided not to disturb the High Court's order due to the special features of the case and the strong evidence indicating the canteen workers were effectively employees of the appellant. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

Separately, the document discusses a related reference to an Industrial Tribunal regarding the status of canteen workers. The Tribunal, after examining control over finances, administration, and discipline, concluded that the workers were indeed employees of the appellant and awarded them appropriate pay scales and benefits. This award was challenged by the appellant, but the Supreme Court found no merit in the appeal, upholding the Tribunal's findings.
