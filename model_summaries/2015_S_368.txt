This case involves an appeal against a Bombay High Court order that dismissed a Letters Patent Appeal. The appellant's claim stems from agricultural land allotted to his father as compensation for property left behind in Pakistan during the partition. The core of the dispute lies in conflicting claims over the area of land, particularly concerning survey numbers 351 and 1182, which were initially allotted to the appellant's father. Subsequently, these lands were declared evacuee property, parts were auctioned, and various mutations were made in revenue records.

The appellant argued that the State Minister for Revenue wrongly entertained a second revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, interfering with concurrent findings of lower revenue authorities. The appellant contended that the minister should not have intervened in findings of fact and that a second revision was not maintainable.

The High Court, in its impugned order, found that the State Minister for Revenue had the jurisdiction to entertain the revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, emphasizing that the code permits more than one revision. The Supreme Court, while acknowledging the appellant's request not to delve into the merits of the land dispute, focused on the maintainability of the second revision. The Court analyzed the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and concluded that the State Government, as the supreme revenue authority and in light of Section 259, can entertain a second revision even if a previous revision was heard by a subordinate revenue officer. Therefore, the Supreme Court found no infirmity in the High Court's order and dismissed the appeal. The parties are free to pursue their remedies in civil court for the adjudication of their land claims.
