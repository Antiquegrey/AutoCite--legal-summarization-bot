This legal document concerns an appeal arising from a judgment of the Gujarat High Court regarding the interpretation and application of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976, and its associated rules. The core issue involves a road widening project in Umra, Surat, where a tenant (the appellant) occupied a portion of a plot (plot no. 178) owned by respondent no. 4.

The government sanctioned a scheme involving road widening, leading to the acquisition of 867 sq m of plot no. 178, leaving the appellant with 200 sq m. Proceedings were initiated for the re-allotment of land. While respondent no. 4 was allotted a final plot (no. 157), the remaining 200 sq m of plot no. 178 merged into final plot no. 165, allotted to respondent no. 3.

The appellant's primary contention was that the allotment of final plots was made without proper notice to him, as a tenant with an interest in the property, violating sections 52 and 53 of the Act. He argued that his interest as a tenant was distinct and should not have been merged with the landlord's interest.

The High Court's single judge and division bench dismissed the appellant's writ petition and subsequent appeal. They reasoned that the appellant had not pursued his objections to the draft scheme and had failed to file objections during the re-allotment proceedings. The court found that the appellant had waived his right to special notice, as the notice provisions in the relevant rules (Rule 26 of the 1979 Rules) did not mandate individual notice, unlike older Bombay rules. The court emphasized that the appellant's inaction allowed the scheme to become final, and he could not now seek to reopen it. While acknowledging that a tenant is a "person interested," the court held that the appellant's conduct amounted to a waiver of his right to equitable relief.

The court concluded that the appellant had lost his right to enforce his claim against the state in a public law forum and suggested he might pursue his claims against the landlord (respondent no. 4) in appropriate proceedings. The appeal was ultimately dismissed.
