This case involves three civil appeals stemming from revision petitions to the High Court of Orissa under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951. The appellant, Shri Achutananda Purohit, an intermediary in possession of vast forests and lands, disputes the compensation awarded to him after his estate vested in the state on April 1, 1960. The core issue is the quantum of compensation, determined by Chapter V of the Act, which outlines the process for calculating gross assets, net income, and the final compensation amount.

The appellant, an 83-year-old advocate arguing in person, raised nine points of contention, most of which were rejected by the Supreme Court. The Court found no merit in arguments concerning the date of vesting as the deadline for compensation calculation, the jurisdiction of the compensation officer, or the exclusion of the Chief Conservator of Forests' approval in certain instances. The Court also dismissed claims for higher interest rates and adjustments for inflation, citing constitutional provisions (Articles 31A, 31B, and 31C) and previous Supreme Court rulings that uphold the Act's provisions regarding compensation calculation and interest rates. The appellant's argument regarding the deduction of income tax was also rejected, as the Act specifies using assumed income for forests, which allows for the deduction of assumed income tax.

The most significant issue revolved around the calculation of gross income from forests. Section 26(v) of the Act requires appraisal by a forest officer, subject to the approval of the Chief Conservator of Forests. The Court found that the Chief Conservator had erred by independently making his own appraisal rather than approving or modifying the forest officer's report. The Court affirmed the High Court's direction for a remand to the compensation officer, clarifying that the integrated process involves the forest officer conducting the appraisal, forwarding it to the Chief Conservator for approval or modification, and then the compensation officer proceeding with the statutory calculation. The Court emphasized the need for this integrated process to be followed to avoid further delays and directed the compensation officer to complete the proceedings within six months.
