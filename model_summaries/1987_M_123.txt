This case is an appeal from a High Court judgment concerning compensation for land acquired by the military. The central dispute revolves around whether Abdul Khader, a flower picker, was a "protected tenant" entitled to 60% of the compensation. The property was originally settled by Sail Nawaz Jung and later subject to a wakfnama. It was requisitioned in 1963 and subsequently acquired. Abdul Khader claimed protected tenant status under the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950. Revenue authorities initially questioned and cancelled his protected tenant entry. However, subsequent legal proceedings, including High Court and Supreme Court orders, directed an arbitrator to decide Abdul Khader's protected tenant status and his share of compensation. The arbitrator found Abdul Khader to be a protected tenant and awarded him 60% of the compensation. The High Court upheld this award. The appellants, owners of the property, argued that the arbitrator and High Court lacked jurisdiction to decide protected tenancy, as this power was exclusively vested in revenue authorities. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine Abdul Khader's interest in the acquired property for compensation purposes, especially given the Supreme Court's prior directions leaving this issue open. The Court found overwhelming evidence supporting Abdul Khader's tenancy and upheld the High Court's decision, dismissing the appeal.
