This case concerns a dispute over the trade mark "Field Marshal" for diesel engines and centrifugal pumps. The first respondent (an individual or entity identified as such) initially registered the mark for diesel engines and later acquired it for flour mills, pumps, and other related items. The appellant began manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps under the same "Field Marshal" mark. The first respondent sued for infringement and passing off, obtaining an ex parte injunction. Subsequently, the original registrant assigned the trade mark, including goodwill, to the appellant. A crucial point of contention arose regarding an application to remove the trade mark from the register due to alleged non-use by the original registrant (M/s Jain Industries). The first respondent argued that M/s Jain Industries had not used the mark for centrifugal pumps for over five years, rendering it vulnerable to removal.

The case went through various legal stages, including proceedings before the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, the High Court, and the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. A key legal question was the interpretation of Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, specifically the phrase "for the time being" in relation to the five-year period of non-use. The appellant argued that the five-year period should not be reset with each assignment of the trade mark, while the first respondent contended that non-use by the predecessor owner could lead to removal.

The court analyzed the relevant provisions of the Act, distinguishing between Section 46 (removal for non-use) and Section 56 (rectification of the register). It examined the meaning of "person aggrieved" and the implications of assignments of trade marks. Ultimately, the court found that the High Court's order, which allowed the first respondent's writ petition and set aside the Board's order, was flawed. The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's judgment, holding that the application for rectification under Section 46(1)(b) was not maintainable without impleading the original registrant and that the interpretation of "for the time being" should not allow the five-year non-use period to be effectively reset with each assignment. The matter was remanded to the Board for fresh adjudication based on the clarified legal principles.
