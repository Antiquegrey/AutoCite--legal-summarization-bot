This legal document concerns two main sets of appeals arising from disputes over land compensation and auction sales involving M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. (the Company).

In the first set of appeals (C.A. Nos. 6169-6171 of 2013 and C.A. Nos. 6172-6174 of 2013), the High Court had directed the State to pay the Company compensation for acquired land based on a compromise, deducting a portion of it and allowing the State to recover that deducted amount from other authorities. The State and the Company both challenged this judgment. The Supreme Court found that the High Court failed to address the full extent of the Company's liabilities at the time of acquisition and wrongly held that certain liabilities and loans were not payable by the Company. Consequently, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order and remitted the matter to the District Collector to determine the Company's liabilities up to the date of vesting, after giving parties a chance to be heard. The State is to pay any remaining amount to the Company or recover any dues from the Company as per law.

In the second set of appeals (related to C.A. Nos. 7122, 7123-7124, 7125, and 7126-7129 of 2003), the dispute involves an auction of the Company's land to recover dues. The High Court had initially cancelled this auction. In a subsequent review application, the High Court ordered a refund of the auction amount to the purchasers. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision to set aside the auction sale. However, on equitable grounds, the Court directed the State to pay interest at the rate of 6% on the amount to be refunded to the auction purchasers, from the date the High Court passed the impugned orders. The appeals related to the cancellation of the auction were dismissed, while the appeals concerning the refund with interest were allowed in part.
