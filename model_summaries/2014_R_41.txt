This document details the appeals of four accused individuals against a common judgment of the High Court of Chhattisgarh, which upheld their conviction by the Additional Sessions Judge. The accused were found guilty of murder (Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) read with Sections 34 (common intention) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. They were sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine.

The prosecution's case alleged that Shashi Tripathi, the stepmother-in-law of the deceased Bhavna Tripathi, hired other accused individuals to murder Bhavna due to domestic disputes. The sole eyewitness was Anil Kumar, a 13-year-old servant who lived with Shashi Tripathi. He testified that Devendra Choubey (accused no. 4) caught Bhavna, and Chandra Prakash (accused no. 2) attacked her with a knife. Mahesh (accused no. 3) was allegedly standing outside the house, and Shashi Tripathi was present inside. Anil Kumar further testified that Chandra Prakash threatened him and that Shashi Tripathi asked him to falsely claim thieves had committed the crime. Hair belonging to Shashi Tripathi was found in the deceased's grip, suggesting a struggle.

The court reviewed the evidence, particularly the testimony of the child witness, Anil Kumar. Despite arguments that the child witness was tutored, the court found his testimony credible, especially as he had no prior acquaintance with the accused and his presence in the house was natural. The court also addressed the delay in the test identification parades for some accused, deeming it not inordinate.

However, regarding Mahesh (accused no. 3), the court found insufficient evidence to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The court noted that Mahesh was merely seen standing outside the house and did not act as a guard. There was no evidence of common intention, conspiracy, or any weapon seized from him. Consequently, the conviction of Mahesh was set aside, and his appeal was allowed. The appeals of the other three accused (Raju Devendra Choubey, Chandra Prakash, and Smt. Shashi Tripathi) were dismissed.
